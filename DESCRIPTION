Description: Offers a general framework of multivariate mixed-effects
        models for the joint analysis of multiple correlated outcomes with clustered 
        data structure and potential missingness. The missing outcome values may 
        depend on the values themselves (missing not at random and non-ignorable), 
        or may depend on only the covariates (missing at random and ignorable), or both.
        This package provides functions for two models: 1) the mvMISE_b model that 
        allows correlated outcome-specific random intercepts with a factor-analytic 
        structure, and 2) the mvMISE_e model that allows the correlated outcome-specific 
        error terms with L1 regularization on the error precision matrix. Both functions 
        are motivated by the multivariate data analyses on data with clustered structure 
        from labelling-based quantitative proteomic studies. Those models and functions 
        can also be applied to univariate and multivariate analyses of clustered data 
        with balanced or unbalanced design and no missingness.
