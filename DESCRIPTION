Title: A General Framework for Multivariate Mixed-Effects Selection Models with
    Potential Missing Data

Description: It offers a general framework for multivariate mixed-effects models
    with potential missing data in the outcome. The missingness can depend on the outcome (missing
    not at random), the covariate of interest (missing at random), or both. The
    multiple outcome variables can have correlated outcome-specific random effects
    with a factor-analytic structure, or correlated outcome-specific error terms
    subject to a graphical lasso penalty. Although it is designed for multivariate
    clustered data with missing values, it can also work for univariate clustered
    data, and fully observed data.
